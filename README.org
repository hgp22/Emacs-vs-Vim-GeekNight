* Presentation

You can see the presentation itself in [[slide.org]] or [[slides.pdf]]. 
To see it in emacs, in presentation mode, you'll need to install
=org-tree-mode=.

You can find some information in [[https://github.com/hgp22/emacs-config/tree/main/Presentations][this usefull repo.]]

* Slides in PDF

I used =org-beamer-export-to-pdf= to generate slides.org in pdf.

To export a file to pdf in your machine, for ubuntu/mint/pop_os distros, you'll need:

- TexLive base
```sudo apt-get install texlive-latex-base```

- Extra fonts and packages to avoid errors when compiling
```
sudo apt-get install texlive-fonts-recommended
sudo apt-get install texlive-fonts-extra
sudo apt-get install texlive-latex-extra
```

And it's ready to use!
